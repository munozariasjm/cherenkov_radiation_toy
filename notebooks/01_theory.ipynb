    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cherenkov Radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The charged particles polarize the molecules of that medium, creating a shockwave of electromagnetic radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic blue glow of underwater nuclear reactors is due to Cherenkov radiation. It is named after Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov, a Soviet scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958.\n"

    "\n",
    "The phenomenon of Cherenkov radiation results from the interaction between a charged particle and the atoms of the medium through which the particle is moving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a charged particle moving through a medium at a velocity $\\vec{v}$. The particle will polarize the atoms of the medium, and these polarized atoms will then return to their ground state, emitting radiation in the process.\n",

    "### The Cherenkov Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "For Cherenkov radiation to occur, the particle must be moving faster than light does in the same medium. In other words, the speed of the particle $v$ must be greater than the speed of light in the medium $c/n$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $n$ is the refractive index of the medium. This can be represented as:\n",

    "\n",
    "The radiation emitted by the polarized atoms forms a cone around the path of the particle. The half-angle of this cone $\\theta_c$, called the Cherenkov angle, is related to the speed of the particle and the speed of light in the medium:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\cos \\theta_c = \\frac{1}{n \\beta} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $e$ is the charge of the particle, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the photons. This formula tells us that the intensity of Cherenkov radiation is proportional to the frequency of the emitted photons."

    "## Derivation of the Frank-Tamm Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the Frank-Tamm formula, we begin with the Larmor formula for the power radiated by an accelerating charged particle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{e^2 a^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 c^3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the acceleration of the particle. For a particle moving at constant velocity, the acceleration is zero, and the Larmor formula gives no radiation. However, in a medium, the particle is constantly interacting with the atoms of the medium and thus can be considered to be continually accelerating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the power per unit solid angle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{e^2 a^2}{16 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0 c^3} \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\sin^2 \\theta \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle between the acceleration and the direction of radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radiation is emitted in a cone around the path of the particle, so the solid angle of the cone is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\Omega = 2\\pi(1 - \\cos \\theta_c) = 2\\pi (1 - \\frac{1}{n\\beta}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The power radiated into this solid angle is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\Delta \\Omega = \\frac{e^2 a^2}{8 \\epsilon_0 c^3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2\\beta^2} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we note that the energy of a photon is $E = \\hbar \\omega$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. The number of photons emitted per unit time is thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N = \\frac{P}{E} = \\frac{e^2 a^2}{8 \\epsilon_0 c^3 \\hbar \\omega} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2\\beta^2} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we consider that the particle is moving at velocity $v$, so the number of photons emitted per unit path length is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dN}{dx} = \\frac{N}{v} = \\frac{e^2 a^2}{8 \\epsilon_0 c^4 \\hbar \\omega} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2\\beta^2} \\right) $$"
