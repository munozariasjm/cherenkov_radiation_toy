# Cherenkov Radiation

## Introduction

Cherenkov Radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The charged particles polarize the molecules of that medium, creating a shockwave of electromagnetic radiation.

The characteristic blue glow of underwater nuclear reactors is due to Cherenkov radiation. It is named after Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov, a Soviet scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958.
