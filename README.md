# Cherenkov Radiation
---

A toy model of Cherenkov Radiation using Python and Matplotlib. It was made for illustration of the electrodynamical physics involved only, and is not meant to be a rigorous simulation of Cherenkov Radiation.

## Introduction

Cherenkov Radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The charged particles polarize the molecules of that medium, creating a shockwave of electromagnetic radiation.

The characteristic blue glow of underwater nuclear reactors is due to Cherenkov radiation. It is named after Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov, a Soviet scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958.

## Theory

Please see the explanation notebook with the thory behind the code here: [Theory](/notebooks/01_theory.ipynb)

## Code

To run the code, please install this package using pip:

```bash
pip install cherenkov-radiation
```

Then, you can run the code using the correct kernel in the other notebooks.
